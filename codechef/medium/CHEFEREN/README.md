## Problem

### Chef Eren

Chef is a very big fan of Eren Yeager.

In the last season of Attack on Titan, there were $N$ episodes numbered from $1$ to $N$.
Each even indexed episode was $A$ minutes long and each odd indexed episode was $B$ minutes long.

Calculate the total duration (in minutes) of the last season.

### Input Format
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $N$, $A,$ and $B$, the number of episodes and the durations of each even-indexed and odd-indexed episodes respectively in minutes.
### Output Format

For each test case, print a single integer on a new line, the total duration of the last season in minutes.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N \leq 60$
- $1 \leq A, B \leq 60$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
1 2 2
2 3 4
4 20 30
```

```
2
7
100
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  There is only one episode, so there is $1$ odd-indexed episode, and $0$ even-indexed episode. The total duration of the season $= 0\cdot A + 1\cdot B = 0\cdot 2 + 1\cdot 2 = 2$.

 **Test case $2$:**  There are two episodes with indices $\{1, 2\}$. Thus, there is $1$ odd-indexed episode $(\{1\})$, and $1$ even-indexed episode $(\{2\})$. The total duration of the season $= 1\cdot A + 1\cdot B = 1\cdot 3 + 1\cdot 4 = 7$.

 **Test case $3$** : There are four episodes with indices $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. Thus, there are $2$ odd-indexed episodes $(\{1, 3\})$, and $2$ even-indexed episodes $(\{2, 4\})$. The total duration of the season $= 2\cdot A + 2\cdot B = 2\cdot 20 + 2\cdot 30 = 100$.

		          int total= (even*a)+(odd* b);
		          
		          System.out.println(total);
		          
		    }
		}
sc.close();
	}
}
