## Problem

### Single-use Attack

Chef is playing a video game, and is now fighting the final boss.

The boss has $H$ health points. Each attack of Chef reduces the health of the boss by $X$.
Chef also has a special attack that can be used  **at most once**, and will decrease the health of the boss by $Y$.

Chef wins when the health of the boss is $\leq 0$.
What is the  **minimum**  number of attacks needed by Chef to win?

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of each test case will contain three space-separated integers $H, X, Y$ — the parameters described in the statement.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of attacks needed by Chef to win.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq X \lt Y \leq H \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
100 25 40
100 29 45
46 1 2
78 15 78

```

```
4
3
45
1

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef can attack the boss $4$ times normally. This results in $25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 100$ damage, which is enough to defeat the boss.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef can attack the boss $2$ times normally, then use the special attack. This results in $29 + 29 + 45 = 103$ damage, which is enough to defeat the boss.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef can proceed as follows:

- First, use the special attack. This leaves the boss with $46 - 2 = 44$ health.
- Then, use $44$ normal attacks to defeat the boss, since each one does $1$ damage.

This takes a total of $44 + 1 = 45$ attacks.

 **Test case $4$:**  Chef can use the special attack to immediately bring the health of the boss to zero, hence only needing one attack.

```py
# cook your dish here
# cook your dish here
T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    H,X,Y=map(int,input().split())
    a=H-Y
    if(a%X==0):
        print((a//X)+1)
    else:
        print((a//X)+2)
```
