## Problem

### Weights

Chef is playing with weights. He has an object weighing $W$ units. He also has three weights each of $X, Y,$ and $Z$ units respectively. Help him determine whether he can measure the  **exact**  weight of the object with one or more of these weights.

If it is possible to measure the weight of object with one or more of these weights, print `YES`, otherwise print `NO`.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of single line containing a four positive integers $W, X, Y,$ and $Z$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line `YES` if it is possible to measure the weight of object with one or more of these weights, otherwise print `NO`.

You may print each character of the string in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `yes`, `YES`, `Yes`, and `yeS` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^4$
- $1 \leq W, X, Y, Z \leq 10^5$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
5 2 1 6
7 9 7 2
20 8 10 12
20 10 11 12

```

```
NO
YES
YES
NO

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  It is not possible to measure $5$ units using any combination of given weights.

 **Test Case $2$:**  Chef can use the second weight of $7$ units to measure the object exactly.

 **Test Case $3$:**  Chef can use combination of first and third weights to measure $8+12=20$ units.

 **Test Case $4$:**  Chef cannot measure $20$ units of weight using any combination of given weights.

import java.io.*;

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
	    Scanner scanner= new Scanner(System.in);
		// your code goes here
		if( scanner.hasNextInt()){
		    int t= scanner.nextInt();
		    
		    
		    while( t-- >0){
		        
		        int w = scanner.nextInt();
		        int x = scanner.nextInt();
		        int y = scanner.nextInt();
		        int z = scanner.nextInt();
		        
		        if( w == x  || w == y || w== z || w== (x+y) || w == (x+z) || w == (y+ z) || w == (x+ y + z)){
		             System.out.println("YES");
		        }else{
		            System.out.println("NO");
		        }		    }
		}

	}
}
