# Coin Change

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return  *the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount*. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= coins.length <= 12
- 1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1
- 0 <= amount <= 104

        dp[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
            for (int coin : coins) {
                if (i - coin >= 0) {
                    dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - coin]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
}
```
